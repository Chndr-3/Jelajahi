Welcome to the Jelajahi! This app showcases the power of Jetpack Compose, a modern Android UI toolkit for building native UIs, by providing a seamless and interactive way to explore a list of countries and their details. Still under development :)

## Features

- **List of Countries:** Browse through an organized list of countries, each represented with its flag, name, and basic information.

- **Country Details:** Tap on a country to view more detailed information, including population, area, languages spoken, and more.

- **Animated UI:** Jetpack Compose's declarative nature makes it easy to implement smooth animations and transitions, enhancing the overall user experience.
